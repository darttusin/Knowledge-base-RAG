torch.Tensor.masked_scatter_ 
=============================================================================================

Tensor. masked_scatter_ ( *mask*  , *source* ) 
:   Copies elements from `source`  into `self`  tensor at positions where
the `mask`  is True. Elements from `source`  are copied into `self`  starting at position 0 of `source`  and continuing in order one-by-one for each
occurrence of `mask`  being True.
The shape of `mask`  must be [broadcastable](../notes/broadcasting.html#broadcasting-semantics)  with the shape of the underlying tensor. The `source`  should have at least
as many elements as the number of ones in `mask`  . 

Parameters
:   * **mask** ( *BoolTensor*  ) – the boolean mask
* **source** ( [*Tensor*](../tensors.html#torch.Tensor "torch.Tensor")  ) – the tensor to copy from

Note 

The `mask`  operates on the `self`  tensor, not on the given `source`  tensor.

Example 

```
>>> self = torch.tensor([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]])
>>> mask = torch.tensor(
...     [[0, 0, 0, 1, 1], [1, 1, 0, 1, 1]],
...     dtype=torch.bool,
... )
>>> source = torch.tensor([[0, 1, 2, 3, 4], [5, 6, 7, 8, 9]])
>>> self.masked_scatter_(mask, source)
tensor([[0, 0, 0, 0, 1],
        [2, 3, 0, 4, 5]])

```
