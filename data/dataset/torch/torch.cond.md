torch.cond 
========================================================

torch. cond ( *pred*  , *true_fn*  , *false_fn*  , *operands = ()* ) [source](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/v2.8.0/torch/_higher_order_ops/cond.py#L62) 
:   Conditionally applies *true_fn* or *false_fn* . 

Warning 

*torch.cond* is a prototype feature in PyTorch. It has limited support for input and output types and
doesn’t support training currently. Please look forward to a more stable implementation in a future version of PyTorch.

*cond* is structured control flow operator. That is, it is like a Python if-statement,
but has restrictions on *true_fn* , *false_fn* , and *operands* that enable it to be
capturable using torch.compile and torch.export. 

Assuming the constraints on *cond* ’s arguments are met, *cond* is equivalent to the following: 

```
def cond(pred, true_branch, false_branch, operands):
    if pred:
        return true_branch(*operands)
    else:
        return false_branch(*operands)

```

Parameters
:   * **pred** ( *Union* *[* [*bool*](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#bool "(in Python v3.13)") *,* [*torch.Tensor*](../tensors.html#torch.Tensor "torch.Tensor") *]*  ) – A boolean expression or a tensor with one element,
indicating which branch function to apply.
* **true_fn** ( *Callable*  ) – A callable function (a -> b) that is within the
scope that is being traced.
* **false_fn** ( *Callable*  ) – A callable function (a -> b) that is within the
scope that is being traced. The true branch and false branch must
have consistent input and outputs, meaning the inputs have to be
the same, and the outputs have to be the same type and shape. Int
output is also allowed. We’ll make the output dynamic by turning it
into a symint.
* **operands** ( *Tuple* *of* *possibly nested dict/list/tuple* *of* [*torch.Tensor*](../tensors.html#torch.Tensor "torch.Tensor")  ) – A tuple of inputs to the
true/false functions. It can be empty if true_fn/false_fn doesn’t require input. Defaults to ().

Return type
:   [*Any*](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.Any "(in Python v3.13)")

Example: 

```
def true_fn(x: torch.Tensor):
    return x.cos()
def false_fn(x: torch.Tensor):
    return x.sin()
return cond(x.shape[0] > 4, true_fn, false_fn, (x,))

```

Restrictions:
:   * The conditional statement (aka *pred* ) must meet one of the following constraints:

    + It’s a *torch.Tensor* with only one element, and torch.bool dtype
        + It’s a boolean expression, e.g. *x.shape[0] > 10* or *x.dim() > 1 and x.shape[1] > 10*
* The branch function (aka *true_fn* / *false_fn* ) must meet all of the following constraints:

    + The function signature must match with operands.
        + The function must return a tensor with the same metadata, e.g. shape,
        dtype, etc.

        + The function cannot have in-place mutations on inputs or global variables.
        (Note: in-place tensor operations such as *add_* for intermediate results
        are allowed in a branch)
