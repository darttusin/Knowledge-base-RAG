Named Tensors 
==============================================================

Named Tensors allow users to give explicit names to tensor dimensions.
In most cases, operations that take dimension parameters will accept
dimension names, avoiding the need to track dimensions by position.
In addition, named tensors use names to automatically check that APIs
are being used correctly at runtime, providing extra safety. Names can
also be used to rearrange dimensions, for example, to support
“broadcasting by name” rather than “broadcasting by position”.

The named tensor API is a prototype feature and subject to change.

Creating named tensors 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Factory functions now take a new `names`  argument that associates a name
with each dimension. 

```
    >>> torch.zeros(2, 3, names=('N', 'C'))
    tensor([[0., 0., 0.],
            [0., 0., 0.]], names=('N', 'C'))

```

Named dimensions, like regular Tensor dimensions, are ordered. `tensor.names[i]`  is the name of dimension `i`  of `tensor`  . 

The following factory functions support named tensors: 

* [`torch.empty()`](generated/torch.empty.html#torch.empty "torch.empty")
* [`torch.rand()`](generated/torch.rand.html#torch.rand "torch.rand")
* [`torch.randn()`](generated/torch.randn.html#torch.randn "torch.randn")
* [`torch.ones()`](generated/torch.ones.html#torch.ones "torch.ones")
* [`torch.tensor()`](generated/torch.tensor.html#torch.tensor "torch.tensor")
* [`torch.zeros()`](generated/torch.zeros.html#torch.zeros "torch.zeros")

Named dimensions 
--------------------------------------------------------------------

See [`names`](#torch.Tensor.names "torch.Tensor.names")  for restrictions on tensor names. 

Use [`names`](#torch.Tensor.names "torch.Tensor.names")  to access the dimension names of a tensor and [`rename()`](#torch.Tensor.rename "torch.Tensor.rename")  to rename named dimensions. 

```
    >>> imgs = torch.randn(1, 2, 2, 3 , names=('N', 'C', 'H', 'W'))
    >>> imgs.names
    ('N', 'C', 'H', 'W')

    >>> renamed_imgs = imgs.rename(H='height', W='width')
    >>> renamed_imgs.names
    ('N', 'C', 'height', 'width)

```

Named tensors can coexist with unnamed tensors; named tensors are instances of [`torch.Tensor`](tensors.html#torch.Tensor "torch.Tensor")  . Unnamed tensors have `None`  -named dimensions. Named
tensors do not require all dimensions to be named. 

```
    >>> imgs = torch.randn(1, 2, 2, 3 , names=(None, 'C', 'H', 'W'))
    >>> imgs.names
    (None, 'C', 'H', 'W')

```

Name propagation semantics 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Named tensors use names to automatically check that APIs are being called
correctly at runtime. This occurs in a process called *name inference*  .
More formally, name inference consists of the following two steps: 

* **Check names** : an operator may perform automatic checks at runtime that
check that certain dimension names must match.
* **Propagate names** : name inference propagates names to output tensors.

All operations that support named tensors propagate names. 

```
    >>> x = torch.randn(3, 3, names=('N', 'C'))
    >>> x.abs().names
    ('N', 'C')

```

### match semantics 

Two names *match*  if they are equal (string equality) or if at least one is `None`  .
Nones are essentially a special “wildcard” name. 

`unify(A, B)`  determines which of the names `A`  and `B`  to propagate to the outputs.
It returns the more *specific*  of the two names, if they match. If the names do not match,
then it errors. 

Note 

In practice, when working with named tensors, one should avoid having unnamed
dimensions because their handling can be complicated. It is recommended to lift
all unnamed dimensions to be named dimensions by using [`refine_names()`](#torch.Tensor.refine_names "torch.Tensor.refine_names")  .

### Basic name inference rules 

Let’s see how `match`  and `unify`  are used in name inference in the case of
adding two one-dim tensors with no broadcasting. 

```
    x = torch.randn(3, names=('X',))
    y = torch.randn(3)
    z = torch.randn(3, names=('Z',))

```

**Check names** : check that the names of the two tensors *match*  . 

For the following examples: 

```
    >>> # x + y  # match('X', None) is True
    >>> # x + z  # match('X', 'Z') is False
    >>> # x + x  # match('X', 'X') is True

    >>> x + z
    Error when attempting to broadcast dims ['X'] and dims ['Z']: dim 'X' and dim 'Z' are at the same position from the right but do not match.

```

**Propagate names** : *unify*  the names to select which one to propagate.
In the case of `x + y`  , `unify('X', None) = 'X'`  because `'X'`  is more
specific than `None`  . 

```
    >>> (x + y).names
    ('X',)
    >>> (x + x).names
    ('X',)

```

For a comprehensive list of name inference rules, see [Named Tensors operator coverage](name_inference.html#name-inference-reference-doc)  .
Here are two common operations that may be useful to go over: 

* Binary arithmetic ops: [Unifies names from inputs](name_inference.html#unifies-names-from-inputs-doc)
* Matrix multiplication ops: [Contracts away dims](name_inference.html#contracts-away-dims-doc)

Explicit alignment by names 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Use [`align_as()`](#torch.Tensor.align_as "torch.Tensor.align_as")  or [`align_to()`](#torch.Tensor.align_to "torch.Tensor.align_to")  to align tensor dimensions
by name to a specified ordering. This is useful for performing “broadcasting by names”. 

```
    # This function is agnostic to the dimension ordering of `input`,
    # as long as it has a `C` dimension somewhere.
    def scale_channels(input, scale):
        scale = scale.refine_names('C')
        return input * scale.align_as(input)

    >>> num_channels = 3
    >>> scale = torch.randn(num_channels, names=('C',))
    >>> imgs = torch.rand(3, 3, 3, num_channels, names=('N', 'H', 'W', 'C'))
    >>> more_imgs = torch.rand(3, num_channels, 3, 3, names=('N', 'C', 'H', 'W'))
    >>> videos = torch.randn(3, num_channels, 3, 3, 3, names=('N', 'C', 'H', 'W', 'D')

    >>> scale_channels(imgs, scale)
    >>> scale_channels(more_imgs, scale)
    >>> scale_channels(videos, scale)

```

Manipulating dimensions 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Use [`align_to()`](#torch.Tensor.align_to "torch.Tensor.align_to")  to permute large amounts of dimensions without
mentioning all of them as in required by [`permute()`](generated/torch.Tensor.permute.html#torch.Tensor.permute "torch.Tensor.permute")  . 

```
    >>> tensor = torch.randn(2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2)
    >>> named_tensor = tensor.refine_names('A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F')

    # Move the F (dim 5) and E dimension (dim 4) to the front while keeping
    # the rest in the same order
    >>> tensor.permute(5, 4, 0, 1, 2, 3)
    >>> named_tensor.align_to('F', 'E', ...)

```

Use [`flatten()`](generated/torch.Tensor.flatten.html#torch.Tensor.flatten "torch.Tensor.flatten")  and [`unflatten()`](generated/torch.Tensor.unflatten.html#torch.Tensor.unflatten "torch.Tensor.unflatten")  to flatten and unflatten
dimensions, respectively. These methods are more verbose than [`view()`](generated/torch.Tensor.view.html#torch.Tensor.view "torch.Tensor.view")  and [`reshape()`](generated/torch.Tensor.reshape.html#torch.Tensor.reshape "torch.Tensor.reshape")  , but have more semantic meaning to someone reading the code. 

```
    >>> imgs = torch.randn(32, 3, 128, 128)
    >>> named_imgs = imgs.refine_names('N', 'C', 'H', 'W')

    >>> flat_imgs = imgs.view(32, -1)
    >>> named_flat_imgs = named_imgs.flatten(['C', 'H', 'W'], 'features')
    >>> named_flat_imgs.names
    ('N', 'features')

    >>> unflattened_named_imgs = named_flat_imgs.unflatten('features', [('C', 3), ('H', 128), ('W', 128)])
    >>> unflattened_named_imgs.names
    ('N', 'C', 'H', 'W')

```

Autograd support 
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Autograd currently supports named tensors in a limited manner: autograd ignores
names on all tensors. Gradient computation is still correct but we lose the
safety that names give us. 

```
    >>> x = torch.randn(3, names=('D',))
    >>> weight = torch.randn(3, names=('D',), requires_grad=True)
    >>> loss = (x - weight).abs()
    >>> grad_loss = torch.randn(3)
    >>> loss.backward(grad_loss)
    >>> weight.grad  # Unnamed for now. Will be named in the future
    tensor([-1.8107, -0.6357,  0.0783])

    >>> weight.grad.zero_()
    >>> grad_loss = grad_loss.refine_names('C')
    >>> loss = (x - weight).abs()
    # Ideally we'd check that the names of loss and grad_loss match but we don't yet.
    >>> loss.backward(grad_loss)
    >>> weight.grad
    tensor([-1.8107, -0.6357,  0.0783])

```

Currently supported operations and subsystems 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Operators 

See [Named Tensors operator coverage](name_inference.html#name-inference-reference-doc)  for a full list of the supported torch and
tensor operations. We do not yet support the following that is not covered by the link: 

* indexing, advanced indexing.

For `torch.nn.functional`  operators, we support the following: 

* [`torch.nn.functional.relu()`](generated/torch.nn.functional.relu.html#torch.nn.functional.relu "torch.nn.functional.relu")
* [`torch.nn.functional.softmax()`](generated/torch.nn.functional.softmax.html#torch.nn.functional.softmax "torch.nn.functional.softmax")
* [`torch.nn.functional.log_softmax()`](generated/torch.nn.functional.log_softmax.html#torch.nn.functional.log_softmax "torch.nn.functional.log_softmax")
* [`torch.nn.functional.tanh()`](generated/torch.nn.functional.tanh.html#torch.nn.functional.tanh "torch.nn.functional.tanh")
* [`torch.nn.functional.sigmoid()`](generated/torch.nn.functional.sigmoid.html#torch.nn.functional.sigmoid "torch.nn.functional.sigmoid")
* [`torch.nn.functional.dropout()`](generated/torch.nn.functional.dropout.html#torch.nn.functional.dropout "torch.nn.functional.dropout")

### Subsystems 

Autograd is supported, see [Autograd support](#named-tensors-autograd-doc)  .
Because gradients are currently unnamed, optimizers may work but are untested. 

NN modules are currently unsupported. This can lead to the following when calling
modules with named tensor inputs: 

* NN module parameters are unnamed, so outputs may be partially named.
* NN module forward passes have code that don’t support named tensors and will
error out appropriately.

We also do not support the following subsystems, though some may work out
of the box: 

* distributions
* serialization ( [`torch.load()`](generated/torch.load.html#torch.load "torch.load")  , [`torch.save()`](generated/torch.save.html#torch.save "torch.save")  )
* multiprocessing
* JIT
* distributed
* ONNX

Named tensor API reference 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In this section please find the documentation for named tensor specific APIs.
For a comprehensive reference for how names are propagated through other PyTorch
operators, see [Named Tensors operator coverage](name_inference.html#name-inference-reference-doc)  . 

*class* torch. Tensor
:   names 
:   Stores names for each of this tensor’s dimensions. 

`names[idx]`  corresponds to the name of tensor dimension `idx`  .
Names are either a string if the dimension is named or `None`  if the
dimension is unnamed. 

Dimension names may contain characters or underscore. Furthermore, a dimension
name must be a valid Python variable name (i.e., does not start with underscore). 

Tensors may not have two named dimensions with the same name. 

Warning 

The named tensor API is experimental and subject to change.

rename ( ** names*  , *** rename_map* ) [source](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/v2.8.0/torch/_tensor.py#L1450) 
:   Renames dimension names of `self`  . 

There are two main usages: 

`self.rename(**rename_map)`  returns a view on tensor that has dims
renamed as specified in the mapping `rename_map`  . 

`self.rename(*names)`  returns a view on tensor, renaming all
dimensions positionally using [`names`](#torch.Tensor.names "torch.Tensor.names")  .
Use `self.rename(None)`  to drop names on a tensor. 

One cannot specify both positional args [`names`](#torch.Tensor.names "torch.Tensor.names")  and keyword args `rename_map`  . 

Examples: 

```
>>> imgs = torch.rand(2, 3, 5, 7, names=('N', 'C', 'H', 'W'))
>>> renamed_imgs = imgs.rename(N='batch', C='channels')
>>> renamed_imgs.names
('batch', 'channels', 'H', 'W')

>>> renamed_imgs = imgs.rename(None)
>>> renamed_imgs.names
(None, None, None, None)

>>> renamed_imgs = imgs.rename('batch', 'channel', 'height', 'width')
>>> renamed_imgs.names
('batch', 'channel', 'height', 'width')

```

rename_ ( ** names*  , *** rename_map* ) [source](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/v2.8.0/torch/_tensor.py#L1435) 
:   In-place version of [`rename()`](#torch.Tensor.rename "torch.Tensor.rename")  .

refine_names ( ** names* ) [source](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/v2.8.0/torch/_tensor.py#L1324) 
:   Refines the dimension names of `self`  according to [`names`](#torch.Tensor.names "torch.Tensor.names")  . 

Refining is a special case of renaming that “lifts” unnamed dimensions.
A `None`  dim can be refined to have any name; a named dim can only be
refined to have the same name. 

Because named tensors can coexist with unnamed tensors, refining names
gives a nice way to write named-tensor-aware code that works with both
named and unnamed tensors. 

[`names`](#torch.Tensor.names "torch.Tensor.names")  may contain up to one Ellipsis ( `...`  ).
The Ellipsis is expanded greedily; it is expanded in-place to fill [`names`](#torch.Tensor.names "torch.Tensor.names")  to the same length as `self.dim()`  using names from the
corresponding indices of `self.names`  . 

Python 2 does not support Ellipsis but one may use a string literal
instead ( `'...'`  ). 

Parameters
: **names** ( *iterable* *of* [*str*](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str "(in Python v3.13)")  ) – The desired names of the output tensor. May
contain up to one Ellipsis.

Examples: 

```
>>> imgs = torch.randn(32, 3, 128, 128)
>>> named_imgs = imgs.refine_names('N', 'C', 'H', 'W')
>>> named_imgs.names
('N', 'C', 'H', 'W')

>>> tensor = torch.randn(2, 3, 5, 7, 11)
>>> tensor = tensor.refine_names('A', ..., 'B', 'C')
>>> tensor.names
('A', None, None, 'B', 'C')

```

The named tensor API is experimental and subject to change.

align_as ( *other* ) → [Tensor](tensors.html#torch.Tensor "torch.Tensor") 
:   Permutes the dimensions of the `self`  tensor to match the dimension order
in the `other`  tensor, adding size-one dims for any new names. 

This operation is useful for explicit broadcasting by names (see examples). 

All of the dims of `self`  must be named in order to use this method.
The resulting tensor is a view on the original tensor. 

All dimension names of `self`  must be present in `other.names`  . `other`  may contain named dimensions that are not in `self.names`  ;
the output tensor has a size-one dimension for each of those new names. 

To align a tensor to a specific order, use [`align_to()`](#torch.Tensor.align_to "torch.Tensor.align_to")  . 

Examples: 

```
# Example 1: Applying a mask
>>> mask = torch.randint(2, [127, 128], dtype=torch.bool).refine_names('W', 'H')
>>> imgs = torch.randn(32, 128, 127, 3, names=('N', 'H', 'W', 'C'))
>>> imgs.masked_fill_(mask.align_as(imgs), 0)

# Example 2: Applying a per-channel-scale
>>> def scale_channels(input, scale):
>>>    scale = scale.refine_names('C')
>>>    return input * scale.align_as(input)

>>> num_channels = 3
>>> scale = torch.randn(num_channels, names=('C',))
>>> imgs = torch.rand(32, 128, 128, num_channels, names=('N', 'H', 'W', 'C'))
>>> more_imgs = torch.rand(32, num_channels, 128, 128, names=('N', 'C', 'H', 'W'))
>>> videos = torch.randn(3, num_channels, 128, 128, 128, names=('N', 'C', 'H', 'W', 'D'))

# scale_channels is agnostic to the dimension order of the input
>>> scale_channels(imgs, scale)
>>> scale_channels(more_imgs, scale)
>>> scale_channels(videos, scale)

align_to ( ** names* ) [source](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/v2.8.0/torch/_tensor.py#L1368) 
:   Permutes the dimensions of the `self`  tensor to match the order
specified in [`names`](#torch.Tensor.names "torch.Tensor.names")  , adding size-one dims for any new names. 

All of the dims of `self`  must be named in order to use this method.
The resulting tensor is a view on the original tensor. 

All dimension names of `self`  must be present in [`names`](#torch.Tensor.names "torch.Tensor.names")  . [`names`](#torch.Tensor.names "torch.Tensor.names")  may contain additional names that are not in `self.names`  ;
the output tensor has a size-one dimension for each of those new names. 

[`names`](#torch.Tensor.names "torch.Tensor.names")  may contain up to one Ellipsis ( `...`  ).
The Ellipsis is expanded to be equal to all dimension names of `self`  that are not mentioned in [`names`](#torch.Tensor.names "torch.Tensor.names")  , in the order that they appear
in `self`  . 

Python 2 does not support Ellipsis but one may use a string literal
instead ( `'...'`  ). 

Parameters
: **names** ( *iterable* *of* [*str*](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str "(in Python v3.13)")  ) – The desired dimension ordering of the
output tensor. May contain up to one Ellipsis that is expanded
to all unmentioned dim names of `self`  .

Examples: 

```
>>> tensor = torch.randn(2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2)
>>> named_tensor = tensor.refine_names('A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F')

# Move the F and E dims to the front while keeping the rest in order
