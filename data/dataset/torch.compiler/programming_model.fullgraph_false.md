Working with `fullgraph=False` 
===============================================================================================

While `fullgraph=False`  is the default `torch.compile`  setting, the semantics of resuming compilation upon encountering a graph break are more complicated.
You can find details on the `fullgraph=False`  semantics in the subsections. 

The strategy for using `torch.compile(fullgraph=False)`  is as follows: 

1. [Determine the ideal location to place `torch.compile`](programming_model.where_to_apply_compile.html)  . Normally, it is the highest-level function that doesn’t result in excessive graph breaks.
Functions that do a lot of preprocessing or I/O operations are examples of functions that result in many graph breaks and do not significantly benefit from `torch.compile`  .
a. You can isolate issues by first compiling individual functions/modules before compiling entire models.
2. [Apply `torch.compiler.disable` to functions in the compiled region that result in a lot of graph breaks
and do not benefit from compilation](programming_model.compiler_disable.html)  . In this case, one graph break is better than potentially tens or hundreds.
3. [Use `TORCH_LOGS="graph_breaks"` or tlparse to investigate remaining graph breaks.](programming_model.observability.html)  Work around these graph breaks using the same approaches as working around graph breaks under
the `fullgraph=True`  programming model. Not all graph breaks need to be removed - some may
impact performance more than others. The general rule is to focus on graph breaks that are happening during model computation.
a. We recommend using `torch.compile(backend='eager')`  when debugging graph breaks, for faster debugging iteration times
