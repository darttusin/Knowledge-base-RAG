torch.broadcast_tensors 
===================================================================================

torch. broadcast_tensors ( ** tensors* ) → List of Tensors [source](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/v2.8.0/torch/functional.py#L48) 
:   Broadcasts the given tensors according to [Broadcasting semantics](../notes/broadcasting.html#broadcasting-semantics)  . 

Parameters
: ***tensors** – any number of tensors of the same type

Warning 

More than one element of a broadcasted tensor may refer to a single
memory location. As a result, in-place operations (especially ones that
are vectorized) may result in incorrect behavior. If you need to write
to the tensors, please clone them first.

Example: 

```
>>> x = torch.arange(3).view(1, 3)
>>> y = torch.arange(2).view(2, 1)
>>> a, b = torch.broadcast_tensors(x, y)
>>> a.size()
torch.Size([2, 3])
>>> a
tensor([[0, 1, 2],
        [0, 1, 2]])

```
