torch.Tensor.q_per_channel_zero_points 
====================================================================================================================

Tensor. q_per_channel_zero_points ( ) → [Tensor](../tensors.html#torch.Tensor "torch.Tensor") 
:   Given a Tensor quantized by linear (affine) per-channel quantization,
returns a tensor of zero_points of the underlying quantizer. It has the number of
elements that matches the corresponding dimensions (from q_per_channel_axis) of
the tensor.
