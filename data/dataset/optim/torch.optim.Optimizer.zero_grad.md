torch.optim.Optimizer.zero_grad 
===================================================================================================

Optimizer. zero_grad ( *set_to_none = True* ) [source](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/v2.8.0/torch/optim/optimizer.py#L996) 
:   Reset the gradients of all optimized [`torch.Tensor`](../tensors.html#torch.Tensor "torch.Tensor")  s. 

Parameters
: **set_to_none** ( [*bool*](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#bool "(in Python v3.13)")  ) – instead of setting to zero, set the grads to None.
This will in general have lower memory footprint, and can modestly improve performance.
However, it changes certain behaviors. For example:
1. When the user tries to access a gradient and perform manual ops on it,
a None attribute or a Tensor full of 0s will behave differently.
2. If the user requests `zero_grad(set_to_none=True)`  followed by a backward pass, `.grad`  s
are guaranteed to be None for params that did not receive a gradient.
3. `torch.optim`  optimizers have a different behavior if the gradient is 0 or None
(in one case it does the step with a gradient of 0 and in the other it skips
the step altogether).
