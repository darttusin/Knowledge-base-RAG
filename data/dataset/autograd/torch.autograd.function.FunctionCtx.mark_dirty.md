torch.autograd.function.FunctionCtx.mark_dirty 
=================================================================================================================================

FunctionCtx. mark_dirty ( ** args* ) [source](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/v2.8.0/torch/autograd/function.py#L151) 
:   Mark given tensors as modified in an in-place operation. 

This should be called at most once, in either the `setup_context()`  or `forward()`  methods, and all arguments should be inputs. 

Every tensor that’s been modified in-place in a call to `forward()`  should be given to this function, to ensure correctness of our checks.
It doesn’t matter whether the function is called before or after
modification. 

Examples::
:   ```
>>> class Inplace(Function):
>>>     @staticmethod
>>>     def forward(ctx, x):
>>>         x_npy = x.numpy() # x_npy shares storage with x
>>>         x_npy += 1
>>>         ctx.mark_dirty(x)
>>>         return x
>>>
>>>     @staticmethod
>>>     @once_differentiable
>>>     def backward(ctx, grad_output):
>>>         return grad_output
>>>
>>> a = torch.tensor(1., requires_grad=True, dtype=torch.double).clone()
>>> b = a * a
>>> Inplace.apply(a)  # This would lead to wrong gradients!
>>>                   # but the engine would not know unless we mark_dirty
>>> b.backward() # RuntimeError: one of the variables needed for gradient
>>>              # computation has been modified by an inplace operation

```
