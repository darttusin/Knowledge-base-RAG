torch.fft.irfftn 
====================================================================

torch.fft. irfftn ( *input*  , *s = None*  , *dim = None*  , *norm = None*  , *** , *out = None* ) → [Tensor](../tensors.html#torch.Tensor "torch.Tensor") 
:   Computes the inverse of [`rfftn()`](torch.fft.rfftn.html#torch.fft.rfftn "torch.fft.rfftn")  . 

`input`  is interpreted as a one-sided Hermitian signal in the Fourier
domain, as produced by [`rfftn()`](torch.fft.rfftn.html#torch.fft.rfftn "torch.fft.rfftn")  . By the Hermitian property, the
output will be real-valued. 

Note 

Some input frequencies must be real-valued to satisfy the Hermitian
property. In these cases the imaginary component will be ignored.
For example, any imaginary component in the zero-frequency term cannot
be represented in a real output and so will always be ignored.

Note 

The correct interpretation of the Hermitian input depends on the length of
the original data, as given by `s`  . This is because each input shape
could correspond to either an odd or even length signal. By default, the
signal is assumed to be even length and odd signals will not round-trip
properly. So, it is recommended to always pass the signal shape `s`  .

Note 

Supports torch.half and torch.chalf on CUDA with GPU Architecture SM53 or greater.
However it only supports powers of 2 signal length in every transformed dimensions.
With default arguments, the size of last dimension should be (2^n + 1) as argument *s* defaults to even output size = 2 * (last_dim_size - 1)

Parameters
:   * **input** ( [*Tensor*](../tensors.html#torch.Tensor "torch.Tensor")  ) – the input tensor
* **s** ( *Tuple* *[* [*int*](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#int "(in Python v3.13)") *]* *,* *optional*  ) – Signal size in the transformed dimensions.
If given, each dimension `dim[i]`  will either be zero-padded or
trimmed to the length `s[i]`  before computing the real FFT.
If a length `-1`  is specified, no padding is done in that dimension.
Defaults to even output in the last dimension: `s[-1] = 2*(input.size(dim[-1]) - 1)`  .
* **dim** ( *Tuple* *[* [*int*](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#int "(in Python v3.13)") *]* *,* *optional*  ) – Dimensions to be transformed.
The last dimension must be the half-Hermitian compressed dimension.
Default: all dimensions, or the last `len(s)`  dimensions if `s`  is given.
* **norm** ( [*str*](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str "(in Python v3.13)") *,* *optional*  ) –

    Normalization mode. For the backward transform
        ( [`irfftn()`](#torch.fft.irfftn "torch.fft.irfftn")  ), these correspond to:

    + `"forward"`  - no normalization
        + `"backward"`  - normalize by `1/n`
        + `"ortho"`  - normalize by `1/sqrt(n)`  (making the real IFFT orthonormal)
        Where `n = prod(s)`  is the logical IFFT size.
        Calling the forward transform ( [`rfftn()`](torch.fft.rfftn.html#torch.fft.rfftn "torch.fft.rfftn")  ) with the same
        normalization mode will apply an overall normalization of `1/n`  between
        the two transforms. This is required to make [`irfftn()`](#torch.fft.irfftn "torch.fft.irfftn")  the exact inverse.

    Default is `"backward"`  (normalize by `1/n`  ).

Keyword Arguments
: **out** ( [*Tensor*](../tensors.html#torch.Tensor "torch.Tensor") *,* *optional*  ) – the output tensor.

Example 

```
>>> t = torch.rand(10, 9)
>>> T = torch.fft.rfftn(t)

```

Without specifying the output length to [`irfft()`](torch.fft.irfft.html#torch.fft.irfft "torch.fft.irfft")  , the output
will not round-trip properly because the input is odd-length in the last
dimension: 

```
>>> torch.fft.irfftn(T).size()
torch.Size([10, 8])

```

So, it is recommended to always pass the signal shape `s`  . 

```
>>> roundtrip = torch.fft.irfftn(T, t.size())
>>> roundtrip.size()
torch.Size([10, 9])
>>> torch.testing.assert_close(roundtrip, t, check_stride=False)

```
