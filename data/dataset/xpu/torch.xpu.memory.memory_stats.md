torch.xpu.memory.memory_stats 
===============================================================================================

torch.xpu.memory. memory_stats ( *device = None* ) [source](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/v2.8.0/torch/xpu/memory.py#L64) 
:   Return a dictionary of XPU memory allocator statistics for a given device. 

The return value of this function is a dictionary of statistics, each of
which is a non-negative integer. 

Core statistics: 

* `"allocated_bytes.{all,large_pool,small_pool}.{current,peak,allocated,freed}"`  :
amount of allocated memory.
* `"reserved_bytes.{all,large_pool,small_pool}.{current,peak,allocated,freed}"`  :
amount of reserved memory.
* `"active_bytes.{all,large_pool,small_pool}.{current,peak,allocated,freed}"`  :
amount of active memory.
* `"requested_bytes.{all,large_pool,small_pool}.{current,peak,allocated,freed}"`  :
memory requested by client code, compare this with allocated_bytes to check if
allocation rounding adds too much overhead.

For these core statistics, values are broken down as follows. 

Pool type: 

* `all`  : combined statistics across all memory pools.
* `large_pool`  : statistics for the large allocation pool (for size >= 1MB allocations).
* `small_pool`  : statistics for the small allocation pool (for size < 1MB allocations).

Metric type: 

* `current`  : current value of this metric.
* `peak`  : maximum value of this metric.
* `allocated`  : historical total increase in this metric.
* `freed`  : historical total decrease in this metric.

Parameters
: **device** ( [*torch.device*](../tensor_attributes.html#torch.device "torch.device") *or* [*int*](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#int "(in Python v3.13)") *or* [*str*](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str "(in Python v3.13)") *,* *optional*  ) – selected device. Returns
statistics for the current device, given by [`current_device()`](torch.xpu.current_device.html#torch.xpu.current_device "torch.xpu.current_device")  ,
if `device`  is `None`  (default).

Return type
:   [dict](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#dict "(in Python v3.13)")  [ [str](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str "(in Python v3.13)")  , [*Any*](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.Any "(in Python v3.13)")  ]
