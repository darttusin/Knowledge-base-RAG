torch.utils.swap_tensors 
=====================================================================================

torch.utils. swap_tensors ( *t1*  , *t2* ) [source](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/v2.8.0/torch/utils/__init__.py#L41) 
:   This function swaps the content of the two Tensor objects.
At a high level, this will make t1 have the content of t2 while preserving
its identity. 

This will not work if t1 and t2 have different slots.
