torch.flatten 
==============================================================

torch. flatten ( *input*  , *start_dim = 0*  , *end_dim = -1* ) → [Tensor](../tensors.html#torch.Tensor "torch.Tensor") 
:   Flattens `input`  by reshaping it into a one-dimensional tensor. If `start_dim`  or `end_dim`  are passed, only dimensions starting with `start_dim`  and ending with `end_dim`  are flattened.
The order of elements in `input`  is unchanged. 

Unlike NumPy’s flatten, which always copies input’s data, this function may return the original object, a view,
or copy. If no dimensions are flattened, then the original object `input`  is returned. Otherwise, if input can
be viewed as the flattened shape, then that view is returned. Finally, only if the input cannot be viewed as the
flattened shape is input’s data copied. See [`torch.Tensor.view()`](torch.Tensor.view.html#torch.Tensor.view "torch.Tensor.view")  for details on when a view will be returned. 

Note 

Flattening a zero-dimensional tensor will return a one-dimensional view.

Parameters
:   * **input** ( [*Tensor*](../tensors.html#torch.Tensor "torch.Tensor")  ) – the input tensor.
* **start_dim** ( [*int*](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#int "(in Python v3.13)")  ) – the first dim to flatten
* **end_dim** ( [*int*](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#int "(in Python v3.13)")  ) – the last dim to flatten

Example: 

```
>>> t = torch.tensor([[[1, 2],
...                    [3, 4]],
...                   [[5, 6],
...                    [7, 8]]])
>>> torch.flatten(t)
tensor([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8])
>>> torch.flatten(t, start_dim=1)
tensor([[1, 2, 3, 4],
        [5, 6, 7, 8]])

```
