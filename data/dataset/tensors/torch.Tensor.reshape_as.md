torch.Tensor.reshape_as 
===================================================================================

Tensor. reshape_as ( *other* ) → [Tensor](../tensors.html#torch.Tensor "torch.Tensor") 
:   Returns this tensor as the same shape as `other`  . `self.reshape_as(other)`  is equivalent to `self.reshape(other.sizes())`  .
This method returns a view if `other.sizes()`  is compatible with the current
shape. See [`torch.Tensor.view()`](torch.Tensor.view.html#torch.Tensor.view "torch.Tensor.view")  on when it is possible to return a view. 

Please see [`reshape()`](torch.reshape.html#torch.reshape "torch.reshape")  for more information about `reshape`  . 

Parameters
: **other** ( [`torch.Tensor`](../tensors.html#torch.Tensor "torch.Tensor")  ) – The result tensor has the same shape
as `other`  .
