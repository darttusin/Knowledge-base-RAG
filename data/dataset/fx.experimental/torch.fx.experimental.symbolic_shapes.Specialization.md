Specialization 
================================================================

*class* torch.fx.experimental.symbolic_shapes. Specialization ( *source*  , *check_fn* ) [source](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/v2.8.0/torch/fx/experimental/symbolic_shapes.py#L1024) 
:   This class is used in multi-graph compilation contexts where we generate
multiple specialized graphs and dispatch to the appropriate one at runtime.
This allows us to optimize the trade-off between performance and generality
by creating specialized versions for common patterns (e.g., x.shape[0] % 16 == 0)
while maintaining a general fallback.
