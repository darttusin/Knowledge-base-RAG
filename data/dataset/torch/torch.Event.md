Event 
==============================================

*class* torch. Event ( *device = None*  , *** , *enable_timing = False*  , *blocking = False*  , *interprocess = False* ) 
:   Query and record Stream status to identify or control dependencies across Stream and measure timing. 

Parameters
:   * **device** ( [`torch.device`](../tensor_attributes.html#torch.device "torch.device")  , optional) – the desired device for the Event.
If not given, the current [accelerator](../torch.html#accelerators)  type will be used.
* **enable_timing** ( [*bool*](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#bool "(in Python v3.13)") *,* *optional*  ) – indicates if the event should measure time (default: `False`  )
* **blocking** ( [*bool*](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#bool "(in Python v3.13)") *,* *optional*  ) – if `True`  , [`wait()`](#torch.Event.wait "torch.Event.wait")  will be blocking (default: `False`  )
* **interprocess** ( [*bool*](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#bool "(in Python v3.13)")  ) – if `True`  , the event can be shared between processes (default: `False`  )

Warning 

Both blocking and interprocess are not supported right now and are noops.

Returns
:   An torch.Event object.

Return type
:   [Event](#torch.Event "torch.Event")

Example: 

```
>>> event = torch.Event()
>>> e_cuda = torch.Event(device='cuda')

```

elapsed_time ( *end_event* ) → [float](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#float "(in Python v3.13)") 
:   Returns the elapsed time in milliseconds between when this event and the `end_event`  are
each recorded via [`torch.Stream.record_event()`](torch.Stream.html#torch.Stream.record_event "torch.Stream.record_event")  . 

Parameters
: **end_event** ( [`torch.Event`](#torch.Event "torch.Event")  ) – The ending event has been recorded.

Returns
:   Time between starting and ending event in milliseconds.

Return type
:   [float](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#float "(in Python v3.13)")

Example: 

```
>>> s_cuda = torch.Stream(device='cuda')
>>> e1_cuda = s_cuda.record_event()
>>> e2_cuda = s_cuda.record_event()
>>> ms = e1_cuda.elapsed_time(e2_cuda)

```

query ( ) → [bool](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#bool "(in Python v3.13)") 
:   Check if the stream where this event was recorded already moved past the point where the event was recorded.
Always returns `True`  if the Event was not recorded. 

Returns
:   A boolean indicating if all work currently captured by event has completed.

Return type
:   [bool](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#bool "(in Python v3.13)")

Example: 

```
>>> s_cuda = torch.Stream(device='cuda')
>>> e_cuda = s_cuda.record_event()
>>> e_cuda.query()
True

```

record ( *stream = None* ) → [None](https://docs.python.org/3/library/constants.html#None "(in Python v3.13)") 
:   Record the event in a given stream. The stream’s device must match the event’s device.
This function is equivalent to `stream.record_event(self)`  . 

Parameters
: **stream** ( [`torch.Stream`](torch.Stream.html#torch.Stream "torch.Stream")  , optional) – A stream to be recorded.
If not given, the current stream will be used.

Example: 

```
>>> e_cuda = torch.Event(device='cuda')
>>> e_cuda.record()

```

synchronize ( ) → [None](https://docs.python.org/3/library/constants.html#None "(in Python v3.13)") 
:   Wait for the event to complete. This prevents the CPU thread from proceeding until the event completes. 

Example: 

```
>>> s_cuda = torch.Stream(device='cuda')
>>> e_cuda = s_cuda.record_event()
>>> e_cuda.synchronize()

```

wait ( *stream = None* ) → [None](https://docs.python.org/3/library/constants.html#None "(in Python v3.13)") 
:   Make all future work submitted to the given stream wait for this event. 

Parameters
: **stream** ( [`torch.Stream`](torch.Stream.html#torch.Stream "torch.Stream")  , optional) – A stream to synchronize.
If not given, the current stream will be used.

Example: 

```
>>> s1_cuda = torch.Stream(device='cuda')
>>> s2_cuda = torch.Stream(device='cuda')
>>> e_cuda = s1_cuda.record()
>>> e_cuda.wait(s2)

```
