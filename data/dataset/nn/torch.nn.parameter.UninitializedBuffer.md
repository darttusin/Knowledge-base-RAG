UninitializedBuffer 
==========================================================================

*class* torch.nn.parameter. UninitializedBuffer ( *requires_grad = False*  , *device = None*  , *dtype = None*  , *persistent = True* ) [source](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/v2.8.0/torch/nn/parameter.py#L254) 
:   A buffer that is not initialized. 

Uninitialized Buffer is a a special case of [`torch.Tensor`](../tensors.html#torch.Tensor "torch.Tensor")  where the shape of the data is still unknown. 

Unlike a [`torch.Tensor`](../tensors.html#torch.Tensor "torch.Tensor")  , uninitialized parameters
hold no data and attempting to access some properties, like their shape,
will throw a runtime error. The only operations that can be performed on a uninitialized
parameter are changing its datatype, moving it to a different device and
converting it to a regular [`torch.Tensor`](../tensors.html#torch.Tensor "torch.Tensor")  . 

The default device or dtype to use when the buffer is materialized can be set
during construction using e.g. `device='cuda'`  .
