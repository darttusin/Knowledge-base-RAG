torch.cuda.memory.empty_cache 
===============================================================================================

torch.cuda.memory. empty_cache ( ) [source](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/v2.8.0/torch/cuda/memory.py#L212) 
:   Release all unoccupied cached memory currently held by the caching
allocator so that those can be used in other GPU application and visible in *nvidia-smi* . 

Note 

`empty_cache()`  doesn’t increase the amount of GPU
memory available for PyTorch. However, it may help reduce fragmentation
of GPU memory in certain cases. See [Memory management](../notes/cuda.html#cuda-memory-management)  for
more details about GPU memory management.
