torch.Tensor.copy_ 
========================================================================

Tensor. copy_ ( *src*  , *non_blocking = False* ) → [Tensor](../tensors.html#torch.Tensor "torch.Tensor") 
:   Copies the elements from `src`  into `self`  tensor and returns `self`  . 

The `src`  tensor must be [broadcastable](../notes/broadcasting.html#broadcasting-semantics)  with the `self`  tensor. It may be of a different data type or reside on a
different device. 

Parameters
:   * **src** ( [*Tensor*](../tensors.html#torch.Tensor "torch.Tensor")  ) – the source tensor to copy from
* **non_blocking** ( [*bool*](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#bool "(in Python v3.13)")  ) – if `True`  and this copy is between CPU and GPU,
the copy may occur asynchronously with respect to the host. For other
cases, this argument has no effect.
