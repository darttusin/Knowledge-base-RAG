torch.frombuffer 
====================================================================

torch. frombuffer ( *buffer*  , *** , *dtype*  , *count = -1*  , *offset = 0*  , *requires_grad = False* ) → [Tensor](../tensors.html#torch.Tensor "torch.Tensor") 
:   Creates a 1-dimensional [`Tensor`](../tensors.html#torch.Tensor "torch.Tensor")  from an object that implements
the Python buffer protocol. 

Skips the first `offset`  bytes in the buffer, and interprets the rest of
the raw bytes as a 1-dimensional tensor of type [`dtype`](../tensor_attributes.html#torch.dtype "torch.dtype")  with `count`  elements. 

Note that either of the following must be true: 

1. `count`  is a positive non-zero number, and the total number of bytes
in the buffer is more than `offset`  plus `count`  times the size
(in bytes) of [`dtype`](../tensor_attributes.html#torch.dtype "torch.dtype")  . 

2. `count`  is negative, and the length (number of bytes) of the buffer
subtracted by the `offset`  is a multiple of the size (in bytes) of [`dtype`](../tensor_attributes.html#torch.dtype "torch.dtype")  . 

The returned tensor and buffer share the same memory. Modifications to
the tensor will be reflected in the buffer and vice versa. The returned
tensor is not resizable. 

Note 

This function increments the reference count for the object that
owns the shared memory. Therefore, such memory will not be deallocated
before the returned tensor goes out of scope.

Warning 

This function’s behavior is undefined when passed an object implementing
the buffer protocol whose data is not on the CPU. Doing so is likely to
cause a segmentation fault.

Warning 

This function does not try to infer the [`dtype`](../tensor_attributes.html#torch.dtype "torch.dtype")  (hence, it is not
optional). Passing a different [`dtype`](../tensor_attributes.html#torch.dtype "torch.dtype")  than its source may result
in unexpected behavior.

Parameters
: **buffer** ( [*object*](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#object "(in Python v3.13)")  ) – a Python object that exposes the buffer interface.

Keyword Arguments
:   * **dtype** ( [`torch.dtype`](../tensor_attributes.html#torch.dtype "torch.dtype")  ) – the desired data type of returned tensor.
* **count** ( [*int*](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#int "(in Python v3.13)") *,* *optional*  ) – the number of desired elements to be read.
If negative, all the elements (until the end of the buffer) will be
read. Default: -1.
* **offset** ( [*int*](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#int "(in Python v3.13)") *,* *optional*  ) – the number of bytes to skip at the start of
the buffer. Default: 0.
* **requires_grad** ( [*bool*](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#bool "(in Python v3.13)") *,* *optional*  ) – If autograd should record operations on the
returned tensor. Default: `False`  .

Example: 

```
>>> import array
>>> a = array.array('i', [1, 2, 3])
>>> t = torch.frombuffer(a, dtype=torch.int32)
>>> t
tensor([ 1,  2,  3])
>>> t[0] = -1
>>> a
array([-1,  2,  3])

>>> # Interprets the signed char bytes as 32-bit integers.
>>> # Each 4 signed char elements will be interpreted as
>>> # 1 signed 32-bit integer.
>>> import array
>>> a = array.array('b', [-1, 0, 0, 0])
>>> torch.frombuffer(a, dtype=torch.int32)
tensor([255], dtype=torch.int32)
