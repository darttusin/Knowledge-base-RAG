torch.utils.data 
===========================================================================

At the heart of PyTorch data loading utility is the [`torch.utils.data.DataLoader`](#torch.utils.data.DataLoader "torch.utils.data.DataLoader")  class. It represents a Python iterable over a dataset, with support for 

* [map-style and iterable-style datasets](#dataset-types)  ,
* [customizing data loading order](#data-loading-order-and-sampler)  ,
* [automatic batching](#loading-batched-and-non-batched-data)  ,
* [single- and multi-process data loading](#single-and-multi-process-data-loading)  ,
* [automatic memory pinning](#memory-pinning)  .

These options are configured by the constructor arguments of a [`DataLoader`](#torch.utils.data.DataLoader "torch.utils.data.DataLoader")  , which has signature: 

```
DataLoader(dataset, batch_size=1, shuffle=False, sampler=None,
           batch_sampler=None, num_workers=0, collate_fn=None,
           pin_memory=False, drop_last=False, timeout=0,
           worker_init_fn=None, *, prefetch_factor=2,
           persistent_workers=False)

```

The sections below describe in details the effects and usages of these options. 

Dataset Types 
--------------------------------------------------------------

The most important argument of [`DataLoader`](#torch.utils.data.DataLoader "torch.utils.data.DataLoader")  constructor is [`dataset`](utils.html#module-torch.utils.data.dataset "torch.utils.data.dataset")  , which indicates a dataset object to load data
from. PyTorch supports two different types of datasets: 

* [Map-style datasets](#map-style-datasets)  ,
* [Iterable-style datasets](#iterable-style-datasets)  .

### Map-style datasets 

A map-style dataset is one that implements the `__getitem__()`  and `__len__()`  protocols, and represents a map from (possibly non-integral)
indices/keys to data samples. 

For example, such a dataset, when accessed with `dataset[idx]`  , could read
the `idx`  -th image and its corresponding label from a folder on the disk. 

See [`Dataset`](#torch.utils.data.Dataset "torch.utils.data.Dataset")  for more details.

### Iterable-style datasets 

An iterable-style dataset is an instance of a subclass of [`IterableDataset`](#torch.utils.data.IterableDataset "torch.utils.data.IterableDataset")  that implements the `__iter__()`  protocol, and represents an iterable over
data samples. This type of datasets is particularly suitable for cases where
random reads are expensive or even improbable, and where the batch size depends
on the fetched data. 

For example, such a dataset, when called `iter(dataset)`  , could return a
stream of data reading from a database, a remote server, or even logs generated
in real time. 

See [`IterableDataset`](#torch.utils.data.IterableDataset "torch.utils.data.IterableDataset")  for more details. 

Note 

When using a [`IterableDataset`](#torch.utils.data.IterableDataset "torch.utils.data.IterableDataset")  with [multi-process data loading](#multi-process-data-loading)  . The same
dataset object is replicated on each worker process, and thus the
replicas must be configured differently to avoid duplicated data. See [`IterableDataset`](#torch.utils.data.IterableDataset "torch.utils.data.IterableDataset")  documentations for how to
achieve this.

Data Loading Order and [`Sampler`](#torch.utils.data.Sampler "torch.utils.data.Sampler") 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For [iterable-style datasets](#iterable-style-datasets)  , data loading order
is entirely controlled by the user-defined iterable. This allows easier
implementations of chunk-reading and dynamic batch size (e.g., by yielding a
batched sample at each time). 

The rest of this section concerns the case with [map-style datasets](#map-style-datasets)  . [`torch.utils.data.Sampler`](#torch.utils.data.Sampler "torch.utils.data.Sampler")  classes are used to specify the sequence of indices/keys used in data loading.
They represent iterable objects over the indices to datasets. E.g., in the
common case with stochastic gradient decent (SGD), a [`Sampler`](#torch.utils.data.Sampler "torch.utils.data.Sampler")  could randomly permute a list of indices
and yield each one at a time, or yield a small number of them for mini-batch
SGD. 

A sequential or shuffled sampler will be automatically constructed based on the `shuffle`  argument to a [`DataLoader`](#torch.utils.data.DataLoader "torch.utils.data.DataLoader")  .
Alternatively, users may use the [`sampler`](utils.html#module-torch.utils.data.sampler "torch.utils.data.sampler")  argument to specify a
custom [`Sampler`](#torch.utils.data.Sampler "torch.utils.data.Sampler")  object that at each time yields
the next index/key to fetch. 

A custom [`Sampler`](#torch.utils.data.Sampler "torch.utils.data.Sampler")  that yields a list of batch
indices at a time can be passed as the `batch_sampler`  argument.
Automatic batching can also be enabled via `batch_size`  and `drop_last`  arguments. See [the next section](#loading-batched-and-non-batched-data)  for more details
on this. 

Note 

Neither [`sampler`](utils.html#module-torch.utils.data.sampler "torch.utils.data.sampler")  nor `batch_sampler`  is compatible with
iterable-style datasets, since such datasets have no notion of a key or an
index.

Loading Batched and Non-Batched Data 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[`DataLoader`](#torch.utils.data.DataLoader "torch.utils.data.DataLoader")  supports automatically collating
individual fetched data samples into batches via arguments `batch_size`  , `drop_last`  , `batch_sampler`  , and `collate_fn`  (which has a default function). 

### Automatic batching (default) 

This is the most common case, and corresponds to fetching a minibatch of
data and collating them into batched samples, i.e., containing Tensors with
one dimension being the batch dimension (usually the first). 

When `batch_size`  (default `1`  ) is not `None`  , the data loader yields
batched samples instead of individual samples. `batch_size`  and `drop_last`  arguments are used to specify how the data loader obtains
batches of dataset keys. For map-style datasets, users can alternatively
specify `batch_sampler`  , which yields a list of keys at a time. 

Note 

The `batch_size`  and `drop_last`  arguments essentially are used
to construct a `batch_sampler`  from [`sampler`](utils.html#module-torch.utils.data.sampler "torch.utils.data.sampler")  . For map-style
datasets, the [`sampler`](utils.html#module-torch.utils.data.sampler "torch.utils.data.sampler")  is either provided by user or constructed
based on the `shuffle`  argument. For iterable-style datasets, the [`sampler`](utils.html#module-torch.utils.data.sampler "torch.utils.data.sampler")  is a dummy infinite one. See [this section](#data-loading-order-and-sampler)  on more details on
samplers.

Note 

When fetching from [iterable-style datasets](#iterable-style-datasets)  with [multi-processing](#multi-process-data-loading)  the `drop_last`  argument drops the last non-full batch of each worker’s dataset replica.

After fetching a list of samples using the indices from sampler, the function
passed as the `collate_fn`  argument is used to collate lists of samples
into batches. 

In this case, loading from a map-style dataset is roughly equivalent with: 

```
for indices in batch_sampler:
    yield collate_fn([dataset[i] for i in indices])

```

and loading from an iterable-style dataset is roughly equivalent with: 

```
dataset_iter = iter(dataset)
for indices in batch_sampler:
    yield collate_fn([next(dataset_iter) for _ in indices])

```

A custom `collate_fn`  can be used to customize collation, e.g., padding
sequential data to max length of a batch. See [this section](#dataloader-collate-fn)  on more about `collate_fn`  .

### Disable automatic batching 

In certain cases, users may want to handle batching manually in dataset code,
or simply load individual samples. For example, it could be cheaper to directly
load batched data (e.g., bulk reads from a database or reading continuous
chunks of memory), or the batch size is data dependent, or the program is
designed to work on individual samples. Under these scenarios, it’s likely
better to not use automatic batching (where `collate_fn`  is used to
collate the samples), but let the data loader directly return each member of
the [`dataset`](utils.html#module-torch.utils.data.dataset "torch.utils.data.dataset")  object. 

When both `batch_size`  and `batch_sampler`  are `None`  (default
value for `batch_sampler`  is already `None`  ), automatic batching is
disabled. Each sample obtained from the [`dataset`](utils.html#module-torch.utils.data.dataset "torch.utils.data.dataset")  is processed with the
function passed as the `collate_fn`  argument. 

**When automatic batching is disabled** , the default `collate_fn`  simply
converts NumPy arrays into PyTorch Tensors, and keeps everything else untouched. 

In this case, loading from a map-style dataset is roughly equivalent with: 

```
for index in sampler:
    yield collate_fn(dataset[index])

```

and loading from an iterable-style dataset is roughly equivalent with: 

```
for data in iter(dataset):
    yield collate_fn(data)

```

See [this section](#dataloader-collate-fn)  on more about `collate_fn`  .

### Working with `collate_fn` 

The use of `collate_fn`  is slightly different when automatic batching is
enabled or disabled. 

**When automatic batching is disabled** , `collate_fn`  is called with
each individual data sample, and the output is yielded from the data loader
iterator. In this case, the default `collate_fn`  simply converts NumPy
arrays in PyTorch tensors. 

**When automatic batching is enabled** , `collate_fn`  is called with a list
of data samples at each time. It is expected to collate the input samples into
a batch for yielding from the data loader iterator. The rest of this section
describes the behavior of the default `collate_fn`  ( [`default_collate()`](#torch.utils.data.default_collate "torch.utils.data.default_collate")  ). 

For instance, if each data sample consists of a 3-channel image and an integral
class label, i.e., each element of the dataset returns a tuple `(image, class_index)`  , the default `collate_fn`  collates a list of
such tuples into a single tuple of a batched image tensor and a batched class
label Tensor. In particular, the default `collate_fn`  has the following
properties: 

* It always prepends a new dimension as the batch dimension.
* It automatically converts NumPy arrays and Python numerical values into
PyTorch Tensors.
* It preserves the data structure, e.g., if each sample is a dictionary, it
outputs a dictionary with the same set of keys but batched Tensors as values
(or lists if the values can not be converted into Tensors). Same
for `list`  s, `tuple`  s, `namedtuple`  s, etc.

Users may use customized `collate_fn`  to achieve custom batching, e.g.,
collating along a dimension other than the first, padding sequences of
various lengths, or adding support for custom data types. 

If you run into a situation where the outputs of [`DataLoader`](#torch.utils.data.DataLoader "torch.utils.data.DataLoader")  have dimensions or type that is different from your expectation, you may
want to check your `collate_fn`  .

Single- and Multi-process Data Loading 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A [`DataLoader`](#torch.utils.data.DataLoader "torch.utils.data.DataLoader")  uses single-process data loading by
default. 

Within a Python process, the [Global Interpreter Lock (GIL)](https://wiki.python.org/moin/GlobalInterpreterLock)  prevents true fully parallelizing Python code across threads. To avoid blocking
computation code with data loading, PyTorch provides an easy switch to perform
multi-process data loading by simply setting the argument `num_workers`  to a positive integer. 

### Single-process data loading (default) 

In this mode, data fetching is done in the same process a [`DataLoader`](#torch.utils.data.DataLoader "torch.utils.data.DataLoader")  is initialized. Therefore, data loading
may block computing. However, this mode may be preferred when resource(s) used
for sharing data among processes (e.g., shared memory, file descriptors) is
limited, or when the entire dataset is small and can be loaded entirely in
memory. Additionally, single-process loading often shows more readable error
traces and thus is useful for debugging.

### Multi-process data loading 

Setting the argument `num_workers`  as a positive integer will
turn on multi-process data loading with the specified number of loader worker
processes. 

Warning 

After several iterations, the loader worker processes will consume
the same amount of CPU memory as the parent process for all Python
objects in the parent process which are accessed from the worker
processes. This can be problematic if the Dataset contains a lot of
data (e.g., you are loading a very large list of filenames at Dataset
construction time) and/or you are using a lot of workers (overall
memory usage is `number of workers * size of parent process`  ). The
simplest workaround is to replace Python objects with non-refcounted
representations such as Pandas, Numpy or PyArrow objects. Check out [issue #13246](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/13246#issuecomment-905703662)  for more details on why this occurs and example code for how to
workaround these problems.

In this mode, each time an iterator of a [`DataLoader`](#torch.utils.data.DataLoader "torch.utils.data.DataLoader")  is created (e.g., when you call `enumerate(dataloader)`  ), `num_workers`  worker processes are created. At this point, the [`dataset`](utils.html#module-torch.utils.data.dataset "torch.utils.data.dataset")  , `collate_fn`  , and `worker_init_fn`  are passed to each
worker, where they are used to initialize, and fetch data. This means that
dataset access together with its internal IO, transforms
(including `collate_fn`  ) runs in the worker process. 

[`torch.utils.data.get_worker_info()`](#torch.utils.data.get_worker_info "torch.utils.data.get_worker_info")  returns various useful information
in a worker process (including the worker id, dataset replica, initial seed,
etc.), and returns `None`  in main process. Users may use this function in
dataset code and/or `worker_init_fn`  to individually configure each
dataset replica, and to determine whether the code is running in a worker
process. For example, this can be particularly helpful in sharding the dataset. 

For map-style datasets, the main process generates the indices using [`sampler`](utils.html#module-torch.utils.data.sampler "torch.utils.data.sampler")  and sends them to the workers. So any shuffle randomization is
done in the main process which guides loading by assigning indices to load. 

For iterable-style datasets, since each worker process gets a replica of the [`dataset`](utils.html#module-torch.utils.data.dataset "torch.utils.data.dataset")  object, naive multi-process loading will often result in
duplicated data. Using [`torch.utils.data.get_worker_info()`](#torch.utils.data.get_worker_info "torch.utils.data.get_worker_info")  and/or `worker_init_fn`  , users may configure each replica independently. (See [`IterableDataset`](#torch.utils.data.IterableDataset "torch.utils.data.IterableDataset")  documentations for how to achieve
this. ) For similar reasons, in multi-process loading, the `drop_last`  argument drops the last non-full batch of each worker’s iterable-style dataset
replica. 

Workers are shut down once the end of the iteration is reached, or when the
iterator becomes garbage collected. 

Warning 

It is generally not recommended to return CUDA tensors in multi-process
loading because of many subtleties in using CUDA and sharing CUDA tensors in
multiprocessing (see [CUDA in multiprocessing](notes/multiprocessing.html#multiprocessing-cuda-note)  ). Instead, we recommend
using [automatic memory pinning](#memory-pinning)  (i.e., setting `pin_memory=True`  ), which enables fast data transfer to CUDA-enabled
GPUs.

#### Platform-specific behaviors 

Since workers rely on Python [`multiprocessing`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/multiprocessing.html#module-multiprocessing "(in Python v3.13)")  , worker launch behavior is
different on Windows compared to Unix. 

* On Unix, `fork()`  is the default [`multiprocessing`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/multiprocessing.html#module-multiprocessing "(in Python v3.13)")  start method.
Using `fork()`  , child workers typically can access the [`dataset`](utils.html#module-torch.utils.data.dataset "torch.utils.data.dataset")  and
Python argument functions directly through the cloned address space.
* On Windows or MacOS, `spawn()`  is the default [`multiprocessing`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/multiprocessing.html#module-multiprocessing "(in Python v3.13)")  start method.
Using `spawn()`  , another interpreter is launched which runs your main script,
followed by the internal worker function that receives the [`dataset`](utils.html#module-torch.utils.data.dataset "torch.utils.data.dataset")  , `collate_fn`  and other arguments through [`pickle`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html#module-pickle "(in Python v3.13)")  serialization.

This separate serialization means that you should take two steps to ensure you
are compatible with Windows while using multi-process data loading: 

* Wrap most of you main script’s code within `if __name__ == '__main__':`  block,
to make sure it doesn’t run again (most likely generating error) when each worker
process is launched. You can place your dataset and [`DataLoader`](#torch.utils.data.DataLoader "torch.utils.data.DataLoader")  instance creation logic here, as it doesn’t need to be re-executed in workers.
* Make sure that any custom `collate_fn`  , `worker_init_fn`  or [`dataset`](utils.html#module-torch.utils.data.dataset "torch.utils.data.dataset")  code is declared as top level definitions, outside of the `__main__`  check. This ensures that they are available in worker processes.
(this is needed since functions are pickled as references only, not `bytecode`  .)

#### Randomness in multi-process data loading 

By default, each worker will have its PyTorch seed set to `base_seed + worker_id`  ,
where `base_seed`  is a long generated by main process using its RNG (thereby,
consuming a RNG state mandatorily) or a specified `generator`  . However, seeds for other
libraries may be duplicated upon initializing workers, causing each worker to return
identical random numbers. (See [this section](notes/faq.html#dataloader-workers-random-seed)  in FAQ.). 

In `worker_init_fn`  , you may access the PyTorch seed set for each worker
with either [`torch.utils.data.get_worker_info().seed`](#torch.utils.data.get_worker_info "torch.utils.data.get_worker_info")  or [`torch.initial_seed()`](generated/torch.initial_seed.html#torch.initial_seed "torch.initial_seed")  , and use it to seed other libraries before data
loading.

Memory Pinning 
----------------------------------------------------------------

Host to GPU copies are much faster when they originate from pinned (page-locked)
memory. See [Use pinned memory buffers](notes/cuda.html#cuda-memory-pinning)  for more details on when and how to use
pinned memory generally. 

For data loading, passing `pin_memory=True`  to a [`DataLoader`](#torch.utils.data.DataLoader "torch.utils.data.DataLoader")  will automatically put the fetched data
Tensors in pinned memory, and thus enables faster data transfer to CUDA-enabled
GPUs. 

The default memory pinning logic only recognizes Tensors and maps and iterables
containing Tensors. By default, if the pinning logic sees a batch that is a
custom type (which will occur if you have a `collate_fn`  that returns a
custom batch type), or if each element of your batch is a custom type, the
pinning logic will not recognize them, and it will return that batch (or those
elements) without pinning the memory. To enable memory pinning for custom
batch or data type(s), define a `pin_memory()`  method on your custom
type(s). 

See the example below. 

Example: 

```
class SimpleCustomBatch:
    def __init__(self, data):
        transposed_data = list(zip(*data))
        self.inp = torch.stack(transposed_data[0], 0)
        self.tgt = torch.stack(transposed_data[1], 0)

    # custom memory pinning method on custom type
    def pin_memory(self):
        self.inp = self.inp.pin_memory()
        self.tgt = self.tgt.pin_memory()
        return self

def collate_wrapper(batch):
    return SimpleCustomBatch(batch)

inps = torch.arange(10 * 5, dtype=torch.float32).view(10, 5)
tgts = torch.arange(10 * 5, dtype=torch.float32).view(10, 5)
dataset = TensorDataset(inps, tgts)

loader = DataLoader(dataset, batch_size=2, collate_fn=collate_wrapper,
                    pin_memory=True)

for batch_ndx, sample in enumerate(loader):
    print(sample.inp.is_pinned())
    print(sample.tgt.is_pinned())

```

are returned in a first-in, first-out order. Only applies when `num_workers > 0`  . (default: `True`  )

Warning 

If the `spawn`  start method is used, `worker_init_fn`  cannot be an unpicklable object, e.g., a lambda function. See [Multiprocessing best practices](notes/multiprocessing.html#multiprocessing-best-practices)  on more details related
to multiprocessing in PyTorch.

Warning 

`len(dataloader)`  heuristic is based on the length of the sampler used.
When [`dataset`](utils.html#module-torch.utils.data.dataset "torch.utils.data.dataset")  is an [`IterableDataset`](#torch.utils.data.IterableDataset "torch.utils.data.IterableDataset")  ,
it instead returns an estimate based on `len(dataset) / batch_size`  , with proper
rounding depending on `drop_last`  , regardless of multi-process loading
configurations. This represents the best guess PyTorch can make because PyTorch
trusts user [`dataset`](utils.html#module-torch.utils.data.dataset "torch.utils.data.dataset")  code in correctly handling multi-process
loading to avoid duplicate data. 

However, if sharding results in multiple workers having incomplete last batches,
this estimate can still be inaccurate, because (1) an otherwise complete batch can
be broken into multiple ones and (2) more than one batch worth of samples can be
dropped when `drop_last`  is set. Unfortunately, PyTorch can not detect such
cases in general. 

See [Dataset Types](#id1)  for more details on these two types of datasets and how [`IterableDataset`](#torch.utils.data.IterableDataset "torch.utils.data.IterableDataset")  interacts with [Multi-process data loading](#id10)  .

Warning 

See [Reproducibility](notes/randomness.html#reproducibility)  , and [My data loader workers return identical random numbers](notes/faq.html#dataloader-workers-random-seed)  , and [Randomness in multi-process data loading](#data-loading-randomness)  notes for random seed related questions.

Warning 

Setting *in_order* to *False* can harm reproducibility and may lead to a skewed data
distribution being fed to the trainer in cases with imbalanced data.

*class* torch.utils.data. Dataset [source](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/v2.8.0/torch/utils/data/dataset.py#L39) 
:   An abstract class representing a [`Dataset`](#torch.utils.data.Dataset "torch.utils.data.Dataset")  . 

All datasets that represent a map from keys to data samples should subclass
it. All subclasses should overwrite `__getitem__()`  , supporting fetching a
data sample for a given key. Subclasses could also optionally overwrite `__len__()`  , which is expected to return the size of the dataset by many [`Sampler`](#torch.utils.data.Sampler "torch.utils.data.Sampler")  implementations and the default options
of [`DataLoader`](#torch.utils.data.DataLoader "torch.utils.data.DataLoader")  . Subclasses could also
optionally implement `__getitems__()`  , for speedup batched samples
loading. This method accepts list of indices of samples of batch and returns
list of samples. 

Note 

[`DataLoader`](#torch.utils.data.DataLoader "torch.utils.data.DataLoader")  by default constructs an index
sampler that yields integral indices. To make it work with a map-style
dataset with non-integral indices/keys, a custom sampler must be provided.

*class* torch.utils.data. IterableDataset [source](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/v2.8.0/torch/utils/data/dataset.py#L73) 
:   An iterable Dataset. 

All datasets that represent an iterable of data samples should subclass it.
Such form of datasets is particularly useful when data come from a stream. 

All subclasses should overwrite `__iter__()`  , which would return an
iterator of samples in this dataset. 

When a subclass is used with [`DataLoader`](#torch.utils.data.DataLoader "torch.utils.data.DataLoader")  , each
item in the dataset will be yielded from the [`DataLoader`](#torch.utils.data.DataLoader "torch.utils.data.DataLoader")  iterator. When `num_workers > 0`  , each worker process will have a
different copy of the dataset object, so it is often desired to configure
each copy independently to avoid having duplicate data returned from the
workers. [`get_worker_info()`](#torch.utils.data.get_worker_info "torch.utils.data.get_worker_info")  , when called in a worker
process, returns information about the worker. It can be used in either the
dataset’s `__iter__()`  method or the [`DataLoader`](#torch.utils.data.DataLoader "torch.utils.data.DataLoader")  ‘s `worker_init_fn`  option to modify each copy’s behavior. 

Example 1: splitting workload across all workers in `__iter__()`  : 

```
>>> class MyIterableDataset(torch.utils.data.IterableDataset):
...     def __init__(self, start, end):
...         super(MyIterableDataset).__init__()
...         assert end > start, "this example code only works with end >= start"
...         self.start = start
...         self.end = end
...
...     def __iter__(self):
...         worker_info = torch.utils.data.get_worker_info()
...         if worker_info is None:  # single-process data loading, return the full iterator
...             iter_start = self.start
...             iter_end = self.end
...         else:  # in a worker process
...             # split workload
...             per_worker = int(math.ceil((self.end - self.start) / float(worker_info.num_workers)))
...             worker_id = worker_info.id
...             iter_start = self.start + worker_id * per_worker
...             iter_end = min(iter_start + per_worker, self.end)
...         return iter(range(iter_start, iter_end))
...
>>> # should give same set of data as range(3, 7), i.e., [3, 4, 5, 6].
>>> ds = MyIterableDataset(start=3, end=7)

>>> # Single-process loading
>>> print(list(torch.utils.data.DataLoader(ds, num_workers=0)))
[tensor([3]), tensor([4]), tensor([5]), tensor([6])]

>>> # Multi-process loading with two worker processes
>>> # Worker 0 fetched [3, 4].  Worker 1 fetched [5, 6].
>>> print(list(torch.utils.data.DataLoader(ds, num_workers=2)))
[tensor([3]), tensor([5]), tensor([4]), tensor([6])]

>>> # With even more workers
>>> print(list(torch.utils.data.DataLoader(ds, num_workers=12)))
[tensor([3]), tensor([5]), tensor([4]), tensor([6])]

```

Example 2: splitting workload across all workers using `worker_init_fn`  : 

```
>>> class MyIterableDataset(torch.utils.data.IterableDataset):
...     def __init__(self, start, end):
...         super(MyIterableDataset).__init__()
...         assert end > start, "this example code only works with end >= start"
...         self.start = start
...         self.end = end
...
...     def __iter__(self):
...         return iter(range(self.start, self.end))
...
>>> # should give same set of data as range(3, 7), i.e., [3, 4, 5, 6].
>>> ds = MyIterableDataset(start=3, end=7)

>>> # Single-process loading
>>> print(list(torch.utils.data.DataLoader(ds, num_workers=0)))
[3, 4, 5, 6]
>>>
>>> # Directly doing multi-process loading yields duplicate data
>>> print(list(torch.utils.data.DataLoader(ds, num_workers=2)))
[3, 3, 4, 4, 5, 5, 6, 6]

>>> # Define a `worker_init_fn` that configures each dataset copy differently
>>> def worker_init_fn(worker_id):
...     worker_info = torch.utils.data.get_worker_info()
...     dataset = worker_info.dataset  # the dataset copy in this worker process
...     overall_start = dataset.start
...     overall_end = dataset.end
...     # configure the dataset to only process the split workload
...     per_worker = int(math.ceil((overall_end - overall_start) / float(worker_info.num_workers)))
...     worker_id = worker_info.id
...     dataset.start = overall_start + worker_id * per_worker
...     dataset.end = min(dataset.start + per_worker, overall_end)
...

>>> # Mult-process loading with the custom `worker_init_fn`
>>> # Worker 0 fetched [3, 4].  Worker 1 fetched [5, 6].
>>> print(list(torch.utils.data.DataLoader(ds, num_workers=2, worker_init_fn=worker_init_fn)))
[3, 5, 4, 6]

>>> # With even more workers
>>> print(list(torch.utils.data.DataLoader(ds, num_workers=12, worker_init_fn=worker_init_fn)))
[3, 4, 5, 6]

*class* torch.utils.data. ChainDataset ( *datasets* ) [source](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/v2.8.0/torch/utils/data/dataset.py#L357) 
:   Dataset for chaining multiple [`IterableDataset`](#torch.utils.data.IterableDataset "torch.utils.data.IterableDataset")  s. 

This class is useful to assemble different existing dataset streams. The
chaining operation is done on-the-fly, so concatenating large-scale
datasets with this class will be efficient.

torch.utils.data._utils.collate. collate ( *batch*  , *** , *collate_fn_map = None* ) [source](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/v2.8.0/torch/utils/data/_utils/collate.py#L118) 
:   General collate function that handles collection type of element within each batch. 

The function also opens function registry to deal with specific element types. *default_collate_fn_map* provides default collate functions for tensors, numpy arrays, numbers and strings. 

Parameters
:   * **batch** – a single batch to be collated
* **collate_fn_map** ( [*Optional*](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.Optional "(in Python v3.13)") *[* [*dict*](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#dict "(in Python v3.13)") *[* [*Union*](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.Union "(in Python v3.13)") *[* [*type*](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#type "(in Python v3.13)") *,* [*tuple*](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#tuple "(in Python v3.13)") *[* [*type*](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#type "(in Python v3.13)") *,* *...* *]* *]* *,* [*Callable*](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.Callable "(in Python v3.13)") *]* *]*  ) – Optional dictionary mapping from element type to the corresponding collate function.
If the element type isn’t present in this dictionary,
this function will go through each key of the dictionary in the insertion order to
invoke the corresponding collate function if the element type is a subclass of the key.

Examples 

```
>>> def collate_tensor_fn(batch, *, collate_fn_map):
...     # Extend this function to handle batch of tensors
...     return torch.stack(batch, 0)
>>> def custom_collate(batch):
...     collate_map = {torch.Tensor: collate_tensor_fn}
...     return collate(batch, collate_fn_map=collate_map)
>>> # Extend `default_collate` by in-place modifying `default_collate_fn_map`
>>> default_collate_fn_map.update({torch.Tensor: collate_tensor_fn})

```

Note 

Each collate function requires a positional argument for batch and a keyword argument
for the dictionary of collate functions as *collate_fn_map* .

torch.utils.data. default_collate ( *batch* ) [source](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/v2.8.0/torch/utils/data/_utils/collate.py#L337) 
:   Take in a batch of data and put the elements within the batch into a tensor with an additional outer dimension - batch size. 

The exact output type can be a [`torch.Tensor`](tensors.html#torch.Tensor "torch.Tensor")  , a *Sequence* of [`torch.Tensor`](tensors.html#torch.Tensor "torch.Tensor")  , a
Collection of [`torch.Tensor`](tensors.html#torch.Tensor "torch.Tensor")  , or left unchanged, depending on the input type.
This is used as the default function for collation when *batch_size* or *batch_sampler* is defined in [`DataLoader`](#torch.utils.data.DataLoader "torch.utils.data.DataLoader")  . 

Here is the general input type (based on the type of the element within the batch) to output type mapping: 

> * [`torch.Tensor`](tensors.html#torch.Tensor "torch.Tensor")  -> [`torch.Tensor`](tensors.html#torch.Tensor "torch.Tensor")  (with an added outer dimension batch size)
> * NumPy Arrays -> [`torch.Tensor`](tensors.html#torch.Tensor "torch.Tensor")
> * *float* -> [`torch.Tensor`](tensors.html#torch.Tensor "torch.Tensor")
> * *int* -> [`torch.Tensor`](tensors.html#torch.Tensor "torch.Tensor")
> * *str* -> *str* (unchanged)
> * *bytes* -> *bytes* (unchanged)
> * *Mapping[K, V_i]* -> *Mapping[K, default_collate([V_1, V_2, …])]*
> * *NamedTuple[V1_i, V2_i, …]* -> *NamedTuple[default_collate([V1_1, V1_2, …]),
> default_collate([V2_1, V2_2, …]), …]*
> * *Sequence[V1_i, V2_i, …]* -> *Sequence[default_collate([V1_1, V1_2, …]),
> default_collate([V2_1, V2_2, …]), …]*

Parameters
: **batch** – a single batch to be collated

Examples 

```
>>> # Example with a batch of `int`s:
>>> default_collate([0, 1, 2, 3])
tensor([0, 1, 2, 3])
>>> # Example with a batch of `str`s:
>>> default_collate(['a', 'b', 'c'])
['a', 'b', 'c']
>>> # Example with `Map` inside the batch:
>>> default_collate([{'A': 0, 'B': 1}, {'A': 100, 'B': 100}])
{'A': tensor([  0, 100]), 'B': tensor([  1, 100])}
>>> # Example with `NamedTuple` inside the batch:
>>> Point = namedtuple('Point', ['x', 'y'])
>>> default_collate([Point(0, 0), Point(1, 1)])
Point(x=tensor([0, 1]), y=tensor([0, 1]))
>>> # Example with `Tuple` inside the batch:
>>> default_collate([(0, 1), (2, 3)])
[tensor([0, 2]), tensor([1, 3])]
>>> # Example with `List` inside the batch:
>>> default_collate([[0, 1], [2, 3]])
[tensor([0, 2]), tensor([1, 3])]
>>> # Two options to extend `default_collate` to handle specific type
>>> # Option 1: Write custom collate function and invoke `default_collate`
>>> def custom_collate(batch):
...     elem = batch[0]
...     if isinstance(elem, CustomType):  # Some custom condition
...         return ...
...     else:  # Fall back to `default_collate`
...         return default_collate(batch)
>>> # Option 2: In-place modify `default_collate_fn_map`
>>> def collate_customtype_fn(batch, *, collate_fn_map=None):
...     return ...
>>> default_collate_fn_map.update(CustomType, collate_customtype_fn)
>>> default_collate(batch)  # Handle `CustomType` automatically

```

torch.utils.data. default_convert ( *data* ) [source](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/v2.8.0/torch/utils/data/_utils/collate.py#L23) 
:   Convert each NumPy array element into a [`torch.Tensor`](tensors.html#torch.Tensor "torch.Tensor")  . 

If the input is a *Sequence* , *Collection* , or *Mapping* , it tries to convert each element inside to a [`torch.Tensor`](tensors.html#torch.Tensor "torch.Tensor")  .
If the input is not an NumPy array, it is left unchanged.
This is used as the default function for collation when both *batch_sampler* and *batch_size* are NOT defined in [`DataLoader`](#torch.utils.data.DataLoader "torch.utils.data.DataLoader")  . 

The general input type to output type mapping is similar to that
of [`default_collate()`](#torch.utils.data.default_collate "torch.utils.data.default_collate")  . See the description there for more details. 

Parameters
: **data** – a single data point to be converted

Examples 

```
>>> # Example with `int`
>>> default_convert(0)
0
>>> # Example with NumPy array
>>> default_convert(np.array([0, 1]))
tensor([0, 1])
>>> # Example with NamedTuple
>>> Point = namedtuple('Point', ['x', 'y'])
>>> default_convert(Point(0, 0))
Point(x=0, y=0)
>>> default_convert(Point(np.array(0), np.array(0)))
Point(x=tensor(0), y=tensor(0))
>>> # Example with List
>>> default_convert([np.array([0, 1]), np.array([2, 3])])
[tensor([0, 1]), tensor([2, 3])]

```

torch.utils.data. get_worker_info ( ) [source](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/v2.8.0/torch/utils/data/_utils/worker.py#L101) 
:   Returns the information about the current [`DataLoader`](#torch.utils.data.DataLoader "torch.utils.data.DataLoader")  iterator worker process. 

When called in a worker, this returns an object guaranteed to have the
following attributes: 

* `id`  : the current worker id.
* `num_workers`  : the total number of workers.
* `seed`  : the random seed set for the current worker. This value is
determined by main process RNG and the worker id. See [`DataLoader`](#torch.utils.data.DataLoader "torch.utils.data.DataLoader")  ’s documentation for more details.
* [`dataset`](utils.html#module-torch.utils.data.dataset "torch.utils.data.dataset")  : the copy of the dataset object in **this** process. Note
that this will be a different object in a different process than the one
in the main process.

When called in the main process, this returns `None`  . 

Note 

When used in a `worker_init_fn`  passed over to [`DataLoader`](#torch.utils.data.DataLoader "torch.utils.data.DataLoader")  , this method can be useful to
set up each worker process differently, for instance, using `worker_id`  to configure the `dataset`  object to only read a specific fraction of a
sharded dataset, or use `seed`  to seed other libraries used in dataset
code.

Return type
:   [*Optional*](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.Optional "(in Python v3.13)")  [ *WorkerInfo*  ]

torch.utils.data. random_split ( *dataset*  , *lengths*  , *generator=<torch._C.Generator object>* ) [source](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/v2.8.0/torch/utils/data/dataset.py#L422) 
:   Randomly split a dataset into non-overlapping new datasets of given lengths. 

If a list of fractions that sum up to 1 is given,
the lengths will be computed automatically as
floor(frac * len(dataset)) for each fraction provided. 

After computing the lengths, if there are any remainders, 1 count will be
distributed in round-robin fashion to the lengths
until there are no remainders left. 

Optionally fix the generator for reproducible results, e.g.: 

Example 

```
>>> generator1 = torch.Generator().manual_seed(42)
>>> generator2 = torch.Generator().manual_seed(42)
>>> random_split(range(10), [3, 7], generator=generator1)
>>> random_split(range(30), [0.3, 0.3, 0.4], generator=generator2)

```

Parameters
:   * **dataset** ( [*Dataset*](#torch.utils.data.Dataset "torch.utils.data.Dataset")  ) – Dataset to be split
* **lengths** ( *sequence*  ) – lengths or fractions of splits to be produced
* **generator** ( [*Generator*](generated/torch.Generator.html#torch.Generator "torch.Generator")  ) – Generator used for the random permutation.

Return type
:   [list](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#list "(in Python v3.13)")  [ [torch.utils.data.dataset.Subset](#torch.utils.data.Subset "torch.utils.data.dataset.Subset")  [~_T]]

*class* torch.utils.data. Sampler ( *data_source = None* ) [source](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/v2.8.0/torch/utils/data/sampler.py#L22) 
:   Base class for all Samplers. 

Every Sampler subclass has to provide an `__iter__()`  method, providing a
way to iterate over indices or lists of indices (batches) of dataset elements,
and may provide a `__len__()`  method that returns the length of the returned iterators. 

Parameters
: **data_source** ( [*Dataset*](#torch.utils.data.Dataset "torch.utils.data.Dataset")  ) – This argument is not used and will be removed in 2.2.0.
You may still have custom implementation that utilizes it.

Example 

```
>>> class AccedingSequenceLengthSampler(Sampler[int]):
>>>     def __init__(self, data: List[str]) -> None:
>>>         self.data = data
>>>
>>>     def __len__(self) -> int:
>>>         return len(self.data)
>>>
>>>     def __iter__(self) -> Iterator[int]:
>>>         sizes = torch.tensor([len(x) for x in self.data])
>>>         yield from torch.argsort(sizes).tolist()
>>>
>>> class AccedingSequenceLengthBatchSampler(Sampler[List[int]]):
>>>     def __init__(self, data: List[str], batch_size: int) -> None:
>>>         self.data = data
>>>         self.batch_size = batch_size
>>>
>>>     def __len__(self) -> int:
>>>         return (len(self.data) + self.batch_size - 1) // self.batch_size
>>>
>>>     def __iter__(self) -> Iterator[List[int]]:
>>>         sizes = torch.tensor([len(x) for x in self.data])
>>>         for batch in torch.chunk(torch.argsort(sizes), len(self)):
>>>             yield batch.tolist()

```

Note 

The `__len__()`  method isn’t strictly required by [`DataLoader`](#torch.utils.data.DataLoader "torch.utils.data.DataLoader")  , but is expected in any
calculation involving the length of a [`DataLoader`](#torch.utils.data.DataLoader "torch.utils.data.DataLoader")  .

sample index is drawn for a row, it cannot be drawn again for that row.
* **generator** ( [*Generator*](generated/torch.Generator.html#torch.Generator "torch.Generator")  ) – Generator used in sampling.

Example 

```

*class* torch.utils.data.distributed. DistributedSampler ( *dataset*  , *num_replicas = None*  , *rank = None*  , *shuffle = True*  , *seed = 0*  , *drop_last = False* ) [source](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/v2.8.0/torch/utils/data/distributed.py#L17) 
:   Sampler that restricts data loading to a subset of the dataset. 

It is especially useful in conjunction with [`torch.nn.parallel.DistributedDataParallel`](generated/torch.nn.parallel.DistributedDataParallel.html#torch.nn.parallel.DistributedDataParallel "torch.nn.parallel.DistributedDataParallel")  . In such a case, each
process can pass a `DistributedSampler`  instance as a [`DataLoader`](#torch.utils.data.DataLoader "torch.utils.data.DataLoader")  sampler, and load a subset of the
original dataset that is exclusive to it. 

Note 

Dataset is assumed to be of constant size and that any instance of it always
returns the same elements in the same order.

Parameters
:   * **dataset** ( [*Dataset*](#torch.utils.data.Dataset "torch.utils.data.dataset.Dataset")  ) – Dataset used for sampling.
* **num_replicas** ( [*int*](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#int "(in Python v3.13)") *,* *optional*  ) – Number of processes participating in
distributed training. By default, `world_size`  is retrieved from the
current distributed group.
* **rank** ( [*int*](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#int "(in Python v3.13)") *,* *optional*  ) – Rank of the current process within `num_replicas`  .
By default, `rank`  is retrieved from the current distributed
group.
* **shuffle** ( [*bool*](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#bool "(in Python v3.13)") *,* *optional*  ) – If `True`  (default), sampler will shuffle the
indices.
* **seed** ( [*int*](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#int "(in Python v3.13)") *,* *optional*  ) – random seed used to shuffle the sampler if `shuffle=True`  . This number should be identical across all
processes in the distributed group. Default: `0`  .
* **drop_last** ( [*bool*](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#bool "(in Python v3.13)") *,* *optional*  ) – if `True`  , then the sampler will drop the
tail of the data to make it evenly divisible across the number of
replicas. If `False`  , the sampler will add extra indices to make
the data evenly divisible across the replicas. Default: `False`  .

Warning 

In distributed mode, calling the `set_epoch()`  method at
the beginning of each epoch **before** creating the `DataLoader`  iterator
is necessary to make shuffling work properly across multiple epochs. Otherwise,
the same ordering will be always used.

Example: 

```
>>> sampler = DistributedSampler(dataset) if is_distributed else None
>>> loader = DataLoader(dataset, shuffle=(sampler is None),
...                     sampler=sampler)
>>> for epoch in range(start_epoch, n_epochs):
...     if is_distributed:
...         sampler.set_epoch(epoch)
...     train(loader)

```
