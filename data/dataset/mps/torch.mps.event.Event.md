Event 
==============================================

*class* torch.mps.event. Event ( *enable_timing = False* ) [source](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/v2.8.0/torch/mps/event.py#L4) 
:   Wrapper around an MPS event. 

MPS events are synchronization markers that can be used to monitor the
device’s progress, to accurately measure timing, and to synchronize MPS streams. 

Parameters
: **enable_timing** ( [*bool*](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#bool "(in Python v3.13)") *,* *optional*  ) – indicates if the event should measure time
(default: `False`  )

elapsed_time ( *end_event* ) [source](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/v2.8.0/torch/mps/event.py#L41) 
:   Returns the time elapsed in milliseconds after the event was
recorded and before the end_event was recorded. 

Return type
:   [float](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#float "(in Python v3.13)")

query ( ) [source](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/v2.8.0/torch/mps/event.py#L31) 
:   Returns True if all work currently captured by event has completed. 

Return type
:   [bool](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#bool "(in Python v3.13)")

record ( ) [source](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/v2.8.0/torch/mps/event.py#L23) 
:   Records the event in the default stream.

synchronize ( ) [source](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/v2.8.0/torch/mps/event.py#L35) 
:   Waits until the completion of all work currently captured in this event.
This prevents the CPU thread from proceeding until the event completes.

wait ( ) [source](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/v2.8.0/torch/mps/event.py#L27) 
:   Makes all future work submitted to the default stream wait for this event.
