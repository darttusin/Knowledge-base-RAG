torch.fx.experimental.symbolic_shapes. guard_size_oblivious ( *expr* ) [source](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/v2.8.0/torch/fx/experimental/symbolic_shapes.py#L463) 
:   Perform a guard on a symbolic boolean expression in a size oblivious way.
This is typically used when a non-oblivious test would result in a guard
on a data dependent value of which we don’t know the value of at compile time.
When a guard is tested this way, we may diverge in behavior from how regular
PyTorch semantics would treat it. For more information, see [pytorch/pytorch#118579](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/118579) 

Return type
:   [bool](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#bool "(in Python v3.13)")
