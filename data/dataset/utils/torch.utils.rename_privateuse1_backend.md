torch.utils.rename_privateuse1_backend 
==================================================================================================================

torch.utils. rename_privateuse1_backend ( *backend_name* ) [source](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/v2.8.0/torch/utils/backend_registration.py#L18) 
:   Rename the privateuse1 backend device to make it more convenient to use as a device name within PyTorch APIs. 

The steps are: 

1. (In C++) implement kernels for various torch operations, and register them
to the PrivateUse1 dispatch key.
2. (In python) call torch.utils.rename_privateuse1_backend(“foo”)

You can now use “foo” as an ordinary device string in python. 

Note: this API can only be called once per process. Attempting to change
the external backend after it’s already been set will result in an error. 

Note(AMP): If you want to support AMP on your device, you can register a custom backend module.
The backend must register a custom backend module with `torch._register_device_module("foo", BackendModule)`  .
BackendModule needs to have the following API’s: 

1. `get_amp_supported_dtype() -> List[torch.dtype]`  get the supported dtypes on your “foo” device in AMP, maybe the “foo” device supports one more dtype.

Note(random): If you want to support to set seed for your device, BackendModule needs to have the following API’s: 

1. `_is_in_bad_fork() -> bool`  Return `True`  if now it is in bad_fork, else return `False`  .
2. `manual_seed_all(seed int) -> None`  Sets the seed for generating random numbers for your devices.
3. `device_count() -> int`  Returns the number of “foo”s available.
4. `get_rng_state(device: Union[int, str, torch.device] = 'foo') -> Tensor`  Returns a list of ByteTensor representing the random number states of all devices.
5. `set_rng_state(new_state: Tensor, device: Union[int, str, torch.device] = 'foo') -> None`  Sets the random number generator state of the specified “foo” device.

And there are some common funcs: 

1. `is_available() -> bool`  Returns a bool indicating if “foo” is currently available.
2. `current_device() -> int`  Returns the index of a currently selected device.

Example: 

```
>>> torch.utils.rename_privateuse1_backend("foo")
# This will work, assuming that you've implemented the right C++ kernels
# to implement torch.ones.
>>> a = torch.ones(2, device="foo")

```
