torch.nn.functional.unfold 
========================================================================================

torch.nn.functional. unfold ( *input*  , *kernel_size*  , *dilation = 1*  , *padding = 0*  , *stride = 1* ) [source](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/v2.8.0/torch/nn/functional.py#L5578) 
:   Extract sliding local blocks from a batched input tensor. 

Warning 

Currently, only 4-D input tensors (batched image-like tensors) are
supported.

Warning 

More than one element of the unfolded tensor may refer to a single
memory location. As a result, in-place operations (especially ones that
are vectorized) may result in incorrect behavior. If you need to write
to the tensor, please clone it first.

See [`torch.nn.Unfold`](torch.nn.Unfold.html#torch.nn.Unfold "torch.nn.Unfold")  for details 

Return type
:   [*Tensor*](../tensors.html#torch.Tensor "torch.Tensor")
