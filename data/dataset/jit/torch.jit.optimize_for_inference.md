torch.jit.optimize_for_inference 
======================================================================================================

torch.jit. optimize_for_inference ( *mod*  , *other_methods = None* ) [source](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/v2.8.0/torch/jit/_freeze.py#L185) 
:   Perform a set of optimization passes to optimize a model for the purposes of inference. 

If the model is not already frozen, optimize_for_inference
will invoke *torch.jit.freeze* automatically. 

In addition to generic optimizations that should speed up your model regardless
of environment, prepare for inference will also bake in build specific settings
such as the presence of CUDNN or MKLDNN, and may in the future make transformations
which speed things up on one machine but slow things down on another. Accordingly,
serialization is not implemented following invoking *optimize_for_inference* and
is not guaranteed. 

This is still in prototype, and may have the potential to slow down your model.
Primary use cases that have been targeted so far have been vision models on cpu
and gpu to a lesser extent. 

Example (optimizing a module with Conv->Batchnorm): 

```
import torch

in_channels, out_channels = 3, 32
conv = torch.nn.Conv2d(
    in_channels, out_channels, kernel_size=3, stride=2, bias=True
)
bn = torch.nn.BatchNorm2d(out_channels, eps=0.001)
mod = torch.nn.Sequential(conv, bn)
frozen_mod = torch.jit.optimize_for_inference(torch.jit.script(mod.eval()))
assert "batch_norm" not in str(frozen_mod.graph)
# if built with MKLDNN, convolution will be run with MKLDNN weights
assert "MKLDNN" in frozen_mod.graph

```

Return type
:   [*ScriptModule*](torch.jit.ScriptModule.html#torch.jit.ScriptModule "torch.jit._script.ScriptModule")
