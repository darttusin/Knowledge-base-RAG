DimDynamic 
========================================================

*class* torch.fx.experimental.symbolic_shapes. DimDynamic ( *value*  , *names=<not given>*  , **values*  , *module=None*  , *qualname=None*  , *type=None*  , *start=1*  , *boundary=None* ) [source](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/v2.8.0/torch/fx/experimental/symbolic_shapes.py#L1754) 
:   Controls how to perform symbol allocation for a dimension. It is always
sound to default this to DYNAMIC, but the policies DUCK and STATIC can
result in better trace-time and compile-time performance, as they reduce
the number of allocated symbols and generally make your graph more static. 

NB: If we notice you’ve applied a constraint to the dimension, we will
force it to DYNAMIC for simplicity. 

DimDynamic is controlled by a variety of higher level UX features.
Currently: 

* In eager mode, the default policy is DUCK.
:   + The default is changed to STATIC with assume_static_by_default.
    + An individual dim is marked DYNAMIC if you mark_dynamic_dim.
* In export mode, the default policy is STATIC.
:   + An individual dim is marked DYNAMIC if you specify it in
    dynamic_shapes passed to export.
