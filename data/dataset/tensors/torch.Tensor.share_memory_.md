torch.Tensor.share_memory_ 
=========================================================================================

Tensor. share_memory_ ( ) [source](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/v2.8.0/torch/_tensor.py#L829) 
:   Moves the underlying storage to shared memory. 

This is a no-op if the underlying storage is already in shared memory
and for CUDA tensors. Tensors in shared memory cannot be resized. 

See [`torch.UntypedStorage.share_memory_()`](../storage.html#torch.UntypedStorage.share_memory_ "torch.UntypedStorage.share_memory_")  for more details.
