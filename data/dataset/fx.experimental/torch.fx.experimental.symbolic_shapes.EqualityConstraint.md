EqualityConstraint 
========================================================================

*class* torch.fx.experimental.symbolic_shapes. EqualityConstraint ( *warn_only*  , *source_pairs*  , *derived_equalities*  , *phantom_symbols*  , *relaxed_sources* ) [source](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/v2.8.0/torch/fx/experimental/symbolic_shapes.py#L1872) 
:   Represent and decide various kinds of equality constraints between input sources. 

A “source pair” is a pair of input sources for dynamic dimensions that
are specified equal. We represent *source_pairs* in a union-find forest
so that we can efficiently check whether two such sources are transitively equal. 

A “derived equality” relates an input source to an expression over a root.
The root can be another input source, corresponding to some dynamic dimension,
or a phantom symbol that does not directly represent any dynamic dimension. We
represent *derived_equalities* involving input sources in a transitively-closed map
so that we can efficiently check whether an input source is transitively equal to
a given expression over another input source.
(NOTE: In contrast, it is easy to decide whether an input source is transitively equal
to a given expression over a phantom symbol; such expressions are already in canonical
form and so the problem reduces to symbolic expression equality.)
