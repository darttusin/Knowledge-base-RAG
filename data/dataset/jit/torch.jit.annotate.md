torch.jit.annotate 
========================================================================

torch.jit. annotate ( *the_type*  , *the_value* ) [source](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/v2.8.0/torch/jit/__init__.py#L129) 
:   Use to give type of *the_value* in TorchScript compiler. 

This method is a pass-through function that returns *the_value* , used to hint TorchScript
compiler the type of *the_value* . It is a no-op when running outside of TorchScript. 

Though TorchScript can infer correct type for most Python expressions, there are some cases where
type inference can be wrong, including: 

* Empty containers like *[]* and *{}* , which TorchScript assumes to be container of *Tensor*
* Optional types like *Optional[T]* but assigned a valid value of type *T* , TorchScript would assume
it is type *T* rather than *Optional[T]*

Note that *annotate()* does not help in *__init__* method of *torch.nn.Module* subclasses because it
is executed in eager mode. To annotate types of *torch.nn.Module* attributes,
use [`Attribute()`](torch.jit.Attribute.html#torch.jit.Attribute "torch.jit.Attribute")  instead. 

Example: 

```
import torch
from typing import Dict

@torch.jit.script
def fn():
    # Telling TorchScript that this empty dictionary is a (str -> int) dictionary
    # instead of default dictionary type of (str -> Tensor).
    d = torch.jit.annotate(Dict[str, int], {})

    # Without `torch.jit.annotate` above, following statement would fail because of
    # type mismatch.
    d["name"] = 20

```

Parameters
:   * **the_type** – Python type that should be passed to TorchScript compiler as type hint for *the_value*
* **the_value** – Value or expression to hint type for.

Returns
:   *the_value* is passed back as return value.
