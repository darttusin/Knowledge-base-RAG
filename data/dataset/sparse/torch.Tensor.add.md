torch.Tensor.add 
====================================================================

Tensor. add ( *other*  , *** , *alpha = 1* ) → [Tensor](../tensors.html#torch.Tensor "torch.Tensor") 
:   Add a scalar or tensor to `self`  tensor. If both `alpha`  and `other`  are specified, each element of `other`  is scaled by `alpha`  before being used. 

When `other`  is a tensor, the shape of `other`  must be [broadcastable](../notes/broadcasting.html#broadcasting-semantics)  with the shape of the underlying
tensor
