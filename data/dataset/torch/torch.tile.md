torch.tile 
========================================================

torch. tile ( *input*  , *dims* ) → [Tensor](../tensors.html#torch.Tensor "torch.Tensor") 
:   Constructs a tensor by repeating the elements of `input`  .
The `dims`  argument specifies the number of repetitions
in each dimension. 

If `dims`  specifies fewer dimensions than `input`  has, then
ones are prepended to `dims`  until all dimensions are specified.
For example, if `input`  has shape (8, 6, 4, 2) and `dims`  is (2, 2), then `dims`  is treated as (1, 1, 2, 2). 

Analogously, if `input`  has fewer dimensions than `dims`  specifies, then `input`  is treated as if it were unsqueezed at
dimension zero until it has as many dimensions as `dims`  specifies.
For example, if `input`  has shape (4, 2) and `dims`  is (3, 3, 2, 2), then `input`  is treated as if it had the
shape (1, 1, 4, 2). 

Note 

This function is similar to NumPy’s tile function.

Parameters
:   * **input** ( [*Tensor*](../tensors.html#torch.Tensor "torch.Tensor")  ) – the tensor whose elements to repeat.
* **dims** ( [*tuple*](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#tuple "(in Python v3.13)")  ) – the number of repetitions per dimension.

Example: 

```
>>> x = torch.tensor([1, 2, 3])
>>> x.tile((2,))
tensor([1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3])
>>> y = torch.tensor([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
>>> torch.tile(y, (2, 2))
tensor([[1, 2, 1, 2],
        [3, 4, 3, 4],
        [1, 2, 1, 2],
        [3, 4, 3, 4]])

```
