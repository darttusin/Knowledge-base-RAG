torch.fx.experimental.symbolic_shapes. constrain_range ( *a*  , *** , *min*  , *max = None* ) [source](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/v2.8.0/torch/fx/experimental/symbolic_shapes.py#L1598) 
:   Applies a constraint that the passed in SymInt must lie between min-max
inclusive-inclusive, WITHOUT introducing a guard on the SymInt (meaning
that it can be used on unbacked SymInts). If min/max are None, we assume
that the dimension is unbounded in that direction. Repeated application
of constrain_range intersects the ranges. This is a fairly low level API
that doesn’t have a lot of safety guarantees (TODO: provide higher level
APIs). 

Currently, we use this API in the following circumstance: when we allocate
an unbacked SymInt, denoting an integer quantity which is data dependent,
we ordinarily do not know anything about what values it may take. This
means that any sort of guard on it will immediately fail. However, in
many cases, we know something about the unbacked SymInt: for example, we
know that nonzero(x).size(0) must be >= 0. We use constrain_range to
narrow the possible range, declaring that negative symbols are impossible.
This permits to definitely answer True to queries like ‘nnz >= 0’, even if
we don’t know what the actual (hinted) value of ‘nnz’ is. In fact, we
actually use constrain_range to unsoundly discharge common guards: for an
unbacked SymInt produced by nonzero, we will also assume that it is not
equal to 0/1 (even though these are perfectly possible values at runtime),
because we generally expect graphs that are valid for N=2 to also be valid
for N=1.
